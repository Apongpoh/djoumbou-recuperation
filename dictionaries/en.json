        "fpfr01": "Scrap Metal Recycling facilities or “Scrap Yards” are facilities where you can take any unwanted metal or non-metal material where it can be properly disposed of. In different parts of the country, a “Scrap Yard” could also be referred to as a “Junkyard”. Scrap Metals should not be put in our landfills, but rather a place where it can be processed for later melting into new products like washers, dryers, refrigerators or new steel which can be used to make automobiles or buildings.",
        "fpfr02": "Most scrap metal yards will pay you either by cash or by check for your unwanted scrap metal. Since most scrap is heavy or somewhat bulky to move, it is often difficult to get your scrap metal to a scrap metal recycling facility. Many people just don't have the resources to get large scrap metal to a scrap yard, so they will try and dispose of it through the trash. There are a growing amount of people referred to as “Scrap Movers” or “Scrappers” that will offer to remove your Scrap Metal (some for a fee, some for free – really depends on the company and how much you have).",
